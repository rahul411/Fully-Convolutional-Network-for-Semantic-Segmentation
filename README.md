# Semantic Image Segmentation
This repository has an implementation for FCNs and PSPNet. 
For PSPNet, using the pre-trained ResNet-101, provided by Tensorflow models library. 
There are three variants of PSPNet being implemented: 
1) with atrous convolutions
2) with normal convolutions
3) with atrous convolutions + focal loss

### Dataset Used:
1) The dataset used is the [augmented Pascal-VOC dataset](http://home.bharathh.info/pubs/codes/SBD/download.html)
2) Cityscapes
Note: The dataset should be placed outside this repo folder.
